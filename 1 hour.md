-   **Git** is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others.
-   **GitHub** is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and enhances collaboration.
-   Git and GitHub are essential tools for software development and version control.
-   Example: Imagine you're working on a project with a team. Git helps you manage changes, while GitHub provides a centralized platform for storing and collaborating on your code.
